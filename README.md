# Clothes-CNN
This repository contains a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained for clothing classification using transfer learning with the Xception model. The model is capable of classifying different types of clothing, such as T-shirts, pants, shorts, etc.

Key Features
Transfer Learning with Xception: Leveraged the pre-trained Xception model to boost the performance of the clothing classification task.

Clothing Dataset: Trained the model on a comprehensive dataset of clothing items, ensuring diverse examples for accurate classification.

Interactive Image Upload: Users can upload images to the trained model for real-time clothing classification.

Topics Explored
Dropout: Implemented dropout layers to improve the model's generalization and prevent overfitting.

Early Stopping: Utilized the EarlyStopping callback to halt training when there is no improvement in validation metrics, preventing potential overfitting.

Learning Rate Optimization: Explored techniques for adjusting the learning rate during training to enhance convergence and performance.

Contents
Jupyter Notebook: A detailed notebook providing insights into the theory of deep learning, code implementation, and model training.

Trained Model: The pre-trained model ready for clothing classification.
